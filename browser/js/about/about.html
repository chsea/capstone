        Windfury is a trading card game that involves turn-based battles between two adversaries. Each game represents a battle between players, who utilize spells and minions depicted on playing cards to defeat their opponent.

        We used Hearthstone as an inspiration for our game because we recognized the potential logistical challenges involved in trying to implement a game with such a complicated rule set and felt building a game similar in structure to Hearthstone would offer interesting learning opportunities.

      <div>
        Rather than just build a clone of a game that already exists, we decided to add a twist by making it based on Fullstack Academy and incorporated Agile Product Development concepts.

        In our game, players can use their cards to attack both the other player, and the other player’s minions. The key to the game is keeping a balance between what to attack and when, as well as structuring your deck in such a way that it synergizes well.

        To win the game, a player must leverage the cards in their hand to reduce their opponent’s health. Each player starts the game with 30 health points and loses when he or she is reduced to zero.
